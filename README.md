Readme

The application searches for duplicate files in the file system.
The logic for this is in 'scanner'. The eframe/egui and egui-dashboard framework is used for display.
After selecting the directory, the scanner thread is started and outputs its output to the graphical interface.
This project is for me to learn the Rust language.
